# Integrated Design Project / Capstone Project

## Project Description
<p><center>In today's digital age, mobile devices have become an integral part of our lives. They enable us to stay connected, access information, and perform various tasks on the go. However, with the increasing reliance on mobile devices, corporate organizations and parents are faced with the challenge of ensuring a secure and controlled mobile environment. This requires addressing concerns such as unauthorized app installations, unrestricted website access, privacy risks associated with bloatware and Google services, and the need for effective device management. To address these challenges, we have undertaken the development of a custom ROM specifically tailored for corporate companies and parents. This custom ROM aims to provide enhanced control mechanisms and prioritize privacy and security, empowering organizations and parents to create a safe and productive digital ecosystem.</center></p>

## Project Procedure
<p><center>Our project is divided into three phases: research, development, and testing. The research phase involves understanding the current state of the art and identifying the requirements of our target users. The development phase involves the implementation of the custom ROM. The testing phase involves the evaluation of the custom ROM.</center></p>

## Project Deliverables
<p><center>Our project will deliver a custom ROM that can be installed on Android devices. The custom ROM will be developed using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and will be based on the latest version of Android. The custom ROM will be designed to provide enhanced control mechanisms and prioritize privacy and security. The custom ROM will be evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.</center></p>
